a closure is a concept that allows a function to remember and access variables
from its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outised the scope

a closure is created when a function(the inner function) is defined 
within another function, and the inner function references variables
from the outer function

HOW CLOSURES WORK INTERNALLY:
When a closure is created, python internally stores a reference to 
the environment where the closure was defined

this allows inner function to access those variables even after outer function has completed

in simple terms, a closure captures the values from its surrounding scope
and retains them for later use

USES OF CLOSURES
Encapsulation:
    closures help encapsulates functionality
    inner function can access variables from the outer function

State retention:
    closure csn retain state across multiple function calls

functional programming:
     are a core feature of functional programming, as they allow you to create flexible and modular completed
