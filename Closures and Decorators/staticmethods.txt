static methods are used in functionalities that relates to the class but do not require any instances to do some work

is a method which is bound to the class and not the object of the class,
it cant access or modify class state

it is present in a class because it makes sense for the methodto be present in that class

SYNTAX:
class C(object):
    @staticmethod
    def fun(arg1, arg2, ...):
        ...

returns a static method for function fun


when  a function decorated with @staticmethod is called, we dont pass an instance of the class to it as it is normally done with methods,
it means that function is put inside the class but it cannot access the instance ofthat class
