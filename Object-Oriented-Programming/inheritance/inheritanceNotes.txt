inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes from another class

this promotes code reuse and a hierachial class srtucture

SYNTAX:
class ParentClass:

    # Parent class code here
    pass

class ChildClass(ParentClass):

    # Child class code here
    pass

Parent class: is the base class from which other classes inherit
              contains attributes and methods that the child classcan reuse

Child class: derived class that inherits from the parent class


a parent class defines the common attributes and methods that can be inherited by other classes
by using inheritance child classes can access and extend the functionality provided by the parent class


__init__function is a constructor method in python.
it initializes the object's state when the object is created
if the child class does notdefine its own __init__ method, it will automatically inherit the one from the parent class

the super() function is used inside the __init__() method of a chils class,
to call the constructor of the parent and initialize the inherited attributes


once inheritance is established, both parent and child can have their own properties.

TYPES OF INHERITANCE:
1. single inheritance:
        a child class inherits from one parent class

2. multilevel inheritance:
        a child is derived from a class which is derived from another class

3. multiple inheritance:
        a class inherits from mpre than one parent class

4. hierachial inheritance:
        multiple classes inherit from a singleparent class

5. hybrid inheritance:
        a combinantion of more than one type of inheritance
