is the process of hiding the internal state of an object and requiring all interactions to be performed through an objects methods

python achieves encapsulation through:
    public, protected and private attributes

How encapsulation works:
Data hiding:
    the variables are kept private or protected, meaning they are not accessible,
    directly from outside the class. instead they can only be accessed or modified theough the methods

Access through Methods:
     methods act asthe interface through which external code interacts with data stored in the variables
     for instance, getters and setters are common methods used to retrieve and update thevalue of a private variables

Control and security:
    by encapsulating the variables and only allowing their manipulation via methods, 
    the class can enforce rules on how variables are accessed or modified, thus maintaining control and security over the data
