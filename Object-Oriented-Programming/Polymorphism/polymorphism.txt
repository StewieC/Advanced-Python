allows entities like functions and methods or operatoes to ehave differently based on the type of data they are handling

TYPES OF POLYMORPHISM:
Compile-time Polymorphism:
    found in statically typed languages like java and C++ where the behavior of a functions
    or oprtator is resolved during the programs compilation phase

    examples include method overloading

Runtime Polymorphism:
    occurs whenthe behaviorof a method is determined at runtime based on the type of the object

    in python this is achieved through method overriding

    Example:



        class Animal:
            def sound(self):
                return "Some generic sound"
        ​
        class Dog(Animal):
            def sound(self):
                return "Bark"
        ​
        class Cat(Animal):
            def sound(self):
                return "Meow"
        ​
        # Polymorphic behavior
        animals = [Dog(), Cat(), Animal()]
        for animal in animals:
            print(animal.sound())  # Calls the overridden method based on the object type

        Output;
        Bark
        Meow
        Some generic sound
